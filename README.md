A Complete Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset, 
which contains daily activity logs for 33 users.
The goal is to explore activity patterns, clean and preprocess the data, 
and build visualizations to understand users’ lifestyle behavior,
identify activity patterns, uncover insights, and visualize relationships between steps, calories burned, and daily activity intensity.

The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling using Python.
This project is ideal for:

Beginners learning data analytics

Students working on EDA projects

Portfolio building for data analyst roles

Anyone studying fitness patterns and lifestyle behavior
